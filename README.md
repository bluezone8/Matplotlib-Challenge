# Matplotlib Challenge
---
### PURPOSE

The purpose of this repository is to store analyses for the anti-cancer drug testing data for Pymaceuticals   
#

### ANALYTICAL TOOL CHOICE RATIONALE

Two primary tools were chosen for this analysis:
1. Python and Associated Libraries including (but not limited to ):
    a. Pandas
    b. Matplotlib
    c. Numpy
    d. SciPy
2. Jupyter Notebook
They were chosen for the following reasons:
1.  Pandas provides broad and powerful tools for analyzing and manipulating tabular data such as thiose included in this study. Additionally, Matplotlib, Numpy, and SciPy provide extensive charting and mathematical calculation tools that facilitate anaylsis and visualization of the analyses. Though some smaller data sets can be manipulated and analysed in Excel, the desktop application does not have the scalability and flexibility necessary to hadle an analysis of this type.  Thus, the Python libraries provided an excellent solution for this exercise.  
2.  Jupyter Notebook offers unique functionality to facilitate analysis of data using Python libraries.
    (a) Provides the ability to code and test discrete portions of code easily within a total program
    (b)  Contains all code and analytical outputs in one file for convenience of communication. 
#

### APPROACH
The analysis called for the use of several different methods to manipulate the data and output the results visually and textually.  In instances in which there could be opportunities for using the same method, most often a different method was used to expand the value of the analysis as a learning exercise as forcing a different approach to a similar problem dramatically increases the understanding of the material, depth of skills, and familiarity with the tools and challenges.      
#

### INCLUDED ITEMS
The only included items are the Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis and an HTML version of this notebook to facilitate viewing the contents of the notebook without opening the notebook in Jupyter Notebooks. (Note: This has the additional advantage of being able to see the code in color to better read and distiguish comments and code as well as see better formatted tables)
